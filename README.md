# Political-Ideology-Regression
Stata file for analyzing accuracy of ideological self placement from American National Election Survey data for 2016.

I investigated the idea that Americans don't have sophisticated political ideologies. To investigate this idea I looked at the realationship between self stated political ideologies and answers to a battery of ideologically motivated political questions.

By investigating this relationship I was able to see that Americans are actaully quite sophisticated in their understanding of their own political ideology. However it is also true that respondents are very contradictory in their responses to the political questions and thus do not strongly fit into traditional conservative-liberal conceptions.

As a secondary finding, it seems clear that respondents with more education are more ideologically consistent as are respondents that places themselves as being more liberal.
